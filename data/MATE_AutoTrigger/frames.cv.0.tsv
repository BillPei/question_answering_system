windbreaking						In essence, when the wind encounters a porous obstacle such as a windbreak or shelterbelt, air pressure increases on the windward side and air pressure decreases on the leeward side.
windbreaking						Other benefits include providing habitat for wildlife and in some regions the trees are harvested for wood products.
windbreaking						something such as a fence or group of trees that protects an area from the wind
windbreaking						Windbreaks are also planted to help keep snow from drifting onto roadways and even yards.
work						The water has energy, that is, kinetic energy, so, it has the ability to do work.
work						The work done on an object by external forces changes the amount of energy the object has.
work						And the water is doing work.
