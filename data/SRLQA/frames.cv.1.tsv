friction	mechanical waves	move	friction	energy is lost		all mechanical waves must lose energy as they move through a medium because some energy is lost due to friction.
friction		lack of water	friction			An excess of water creates too much suction, whereas a lack of water will create friction.
friction	kinetic energy		friction	converted to heat		Due to friction, kinetic energy is converted to heat and not potential energy.
friction	box		pushing	moves		Part of the energy of your pushing moves the box, and part of the energy is lost to kinetic friction.
friction			friction			In converting one form of energy into another, some energy is ordinarily wasted in overcoming friction.
friction	surfaces	force	resistance			Friction is a force that provides resistance whenever two surfaces are in contact.
friction	box	force	friction	stop		The box pushed across the floor will eventually stop because of the force, or friction, the floor has on the box.
friction	bicycle car	brakes	force exerted	stop		Friction is also the force exerted by brakes on a bicycle or car in order to stop.
friction	objects		slide over one another			When two objects slide over one another friction can occur.
friction	solid surfaces fluid layers material elements	force	resisting | sliding against each other			Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other.
gravity | gravitational pull	water	height above the Earth	gravitational energy			A simple example of potential energy is the gravitational energy of some water at a height above the Earth.
gravity | gravitational pull	water	flowing down	gravitational energy			An example of gravitational energy is water flowing down a waterfall.
gravity | gravitational pull	water		gravitational potential energy			The gravitational potential energy of the water is converting to kinetic energy.
gravity | gravitational pull			gravitational potential energy			Electrical energy and gravitational potential energy are two examples of stored energy.
gravity | gravitational pull	water cycle		gravity			The water cycle is powered by the Sun's energy and the Earth's gravity.
gravity | gravitational pull	you		gravity	come back down to the ground		When you jump up in the air, you come back down to the ground due to gravity.
gravity | gravitational pull	matter		attraction			Gravity, or gravitation, is the attraction of all matter for all other matter.
gravity | gravitational pull	terrestrial bodies	force	attraction	fall toward the center of earth		the force of attraction by which terrestrial bodies tend to fall toward the center of the earth.
gravity | gravitational pull	physical bodies		attract			gravity is a natural phenomenon by which all physical bodies attract each other.
motion	object		motion		energy	Energy: energy an object has when it is in motion.
motion	object		motion		Kinetic energy	The kinetic energy of an object is the energy it has because of its motion.
motion			change of position			A change of position with respect to time.
motion			act of moving			The act of moving from place to place.
motion			changing position			The act or process of changing position or place.
pulling		available water	pull	plant		Most of the available water is used in transpiration to pull nutrients into the plant.
pulling	Roots		pull	water plant		Roots in the ground pull the water up into the plant to keep it healthy.
pulling	Water	soil plant roots evaporation of water occurring the leaf veins	pulled			Water is pulled from the soil into the plant roots via evaporation of water occurring in the leaf veins.
pulling		water moving moon	pull			Since the water is always moving, the moon can pull it.
pulling	water		pulling	themselves take nutrients from the soil		By pulling water into themselves, plants also take in the dissolved nutrients from the soil.
